# Python website
The website is built using the back-end framework called [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) and the front-end framework [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/).
The database will be stored in the "instance" folder once main.py starts to run.
The website will continue to develop and it will be similar to the swedish website called "Blocket",
where users can create advertisements for items that they want to sell or if they want to buy
something from another user.
